<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://kekoziar.github.io/rdap-erc/hub-expand">RDAP Hub, sample page with expandable list.</a> (this example contains no other formatting, while our preference is to add a menu and anchors to jump between sections; also, the page should be formatted within the style of the RDAP website. This is content text and functionality, not borders/padding/etc)
